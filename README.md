# Cow Tab
#### This is a quick and dirty port of this extension to Firefox ####

### A simple new tab page that replicates the classic `fortune | cowsay` command.

It supports all kinds of quote lengths and types! Please make a PR if you see bugs, I'm not good at JS or web dev.

Get it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cowtab/

### To add a cow:
 1. Place your `.cow` file in the "cows" directory
 2. Add the filename to "cows/index.txt"
 3. (Optional) Add a translation to "\_locales/en/messages.json":

        ,
        "option_cowType_filenamecow": {
            "message": "Cow name"
        }

So if I wanted to add `abc-123.cow` I would copy the file to the "cows" directory, add its filename to "cows/index.txt" and add

	,
	"option_cowType_abc123cow": {
		"message": "ABC 123"
	}
at the end of the last translation in "\_locales/en/messages.json".

The cow will then be selectable in the options page.
